It is the end of the June and so the end of the Spring semesters at most universities. Most students will get about 7-8 weeks of free time. This time has reduced from good 10-12 to 7-8 weeks due to (still) disturbed academic schedule due to COVID19. Since there are not many internship opportunities for freshmen in Pakistan, not many get to spend this time on right things. So, I thought to write a short guide to help students navigate through your first summer as a Computer Science or Software Engineering freshman.

Computer Science is one of the disciplines in which your actual homework starts outside the class; When no one is there to monitor you or assign homework projects to teach you technical skills. Everyone who gets to the end of this tough 4-Year journey gets the degree. However, the competition in Tech has become so high, that it is not a good idea to just rely on the degree and the work you do in the classes.  
  
Also, there are many important things that might not be a part of your degree curriculum. Due to these reasons, there are a number of extra things that a CS/SE or anyother related tech student needs to do outside the class. Before I come to the concrete steps here are the general things that you need to focus on during and after summer:

1.  Problem Solving, after all CS is all about solving problems
2.  One general purpose programming language (Java / Python / Ruby / Golang)
3.  Developing Side Projects
4.  Your general knowledge about Software advancements and techie Tools
5.  Showcasing your skills, Portfolio and Networking

# Where do you stand now?

After completing 2 semesters in a CS/SE degree in Pakistan, you become capable enough to at least develop basic Object Oriented Applications using C++ or Java usually, and (optionally) also Graphical Applications (GUI). You should have a good understanding of Composition and using it to create complex class structures, Memory management, Polymorphism, resizable List, File I/O Streams, using Template/Generic classes, writing reusable code using Templates, Function Pointers & Lambdas, Classes and other constructs you studied.  <mark style="background-color:#FFB302;" class="has-inline-color">And above all, a good hand at problem solving!</mark>

Lets move on to navigating the summer.

## Problem Solving 

Start right now and make this a habit for rest of the years to come, <mark style="background-color:#FFB302;" class="has-inline-color">Solving Algorithm Problems</mark>! You can do it using C++ and C++ Standard Template Library. However, you will need to learn the required Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge.  
  
There is an interesting concept around problem solving which is known as Competitive Programming (CP). Join LeetCode.com (for interviews type problems) and one of the CP platforms Google KickStart, CodeForces, HackerRank, TopCoder or CodeChef for more complex problem solving.  
  
There are numerous links to Comptetive Programming guides on Google Search. Get started!

<blockquote>“First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.” – John Johnson</blockquote>

## Programming Language
Learn at least one general purpose programming language really well. You should also learn to use the built in classes and libraries provided by the language you choose. e.g. C++ provides Standard Template Library. It would be good to start with either one of these: Python, Java, Golang or maybe JavaScript.


## Side Projects

Only way to showcase your coding skills is by writing code and developing something useful, and by something I of course mean working Software.  <mark style="background-color:#FFB302;" class="has-inline-color">Build at least one cool software side project this summer to get ahead.</mark>  
  
Preferably you should develop a Web Application. You can get started with Web Development by using this awesome course by Harvard:  <mark style="background-color:#FFB302;" class="has-inline-color">CS50’s Web Programming</mark>  
Link:  [https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)  
  
You can also develop a desktop application by using any of the many available GUI frameworks: Qt C++, PyQt, JavaFX, PyKivy, Gtk and many more. I would prefer to go with Qt or PyQt.

There are is a good list of cool software ideas here:  [https://github.com/vicky002/1000_Projects](https://github.com/vicky002/1000_Projects)

## Tech Tools

Coding and writing software is not enough. Degree classes teach you really advanced concepts but miss out on some important tools that you will spend 100s of hours with in your career. Some of the tools that every Software Engineer should know are using Command Line/Terminal, Version Control with Git, Scripting, Debugging and Profiling and few more listed on the link:  [https://missing.csail.mit.edu/about/](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/about/)

<mark style="background-color:#FFB302;" class="has-inline-color">To teach theses tools, there is an awesome short course made by MIT students known as</mark>  [Hacker Tools or Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)  [https://missing.csail.mit.edu/](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)  
  
It covers a great amount of interesting and useful knowledge, that you should to know become a good engineer.

## Showcasing Skills

Writing cool software in a corner of your room is just one part. You need to showcase your skills. Here are few things that you should do:

1.  Make a GitHub profile and manage your projects’ code there
2.  Contribute to open source projects on GitHub
3.  Make your LinkedIn profile and get connected with your peers and other Software Engineers from around the world
4.  Make a tech blog and write about your favorite topics regularly
